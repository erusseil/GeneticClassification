# GeneticClassification
Applying Gplearn to classify astronomical data

This project attempts at using GP learn regression tool to perform classification : https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#symbolic-regressor.

In the folder Toys you can read about the general idea and in the folder PlastiCC you can read about how it has been applied to astronomical data.

The method works and provides good results, however GPlearn has a direct classifier tool that performs better and should therefore be used instead.
